            <li>4 chicken legs (about 2 lbs)<br>
                boned and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>1 cup katakuriko (potato starch)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
            <li>Steamed rice, for serving</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the chicken, garlic, salt, ginger, sake, <br>
                soy sauce, and mirin in a medium-sized bowl until well combined.<br>
                Cover the bowl with saran wrap. Marinate the chicken for 15 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In another bowl, add the <i>katakuriko</i>. When the chicken is ready,<br>
                squeeze excess marinade from the chicken with your hands and dredge each<br>
                piece in the <i>katakuriko</i>. Shake off the excess starch. <br>
                Place the dredged chicken pieces on a plate. <br>
                <br>
                (Alternatively, pour the <i>katakuriko</i> into a zip-top storage bag, <br>
                add pieces of the chicken, seal the bag, and shake until the chicken<br>
                is coated with the starch. Repeat until all the chicken is coated. <br>
                Place the dredge chicken pieces on a plate.) </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place a cast-iron skillet on a burner. Fill the skillet with vegetable oil<br>
                a height of at least 1 inch. Attach a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side<br>
                of the skillet. On a work surface near the skillet, set up a tray lined with <br>
                newspaper or paper towels to drain the cooked tatsuta age. Turn the heat on to high.<br>
                Heat the oil to 340 F.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the oil has heated to 340 F, add the chicken to the skillet. Depending on the<br>
                size of the skillet, cook the chicken in batches. Be careful not to overfill the<br>
                skillet which will lower the cooking temperature; use at most, half of the surface area<br>
                of the oil to cook.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While the chicken is frying, check the thermometer. Regulate the heat to maintain a constant<br>
                340 F oil temperature. If the oil is too hot, the chicken will burn; if too low, the chicken<br>
                will come out soggy and greasy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Fry the chicken for about 5 minutes, until the chicken turns golden brown. When it's<br>
                ready, transfer the chicken to the paper-lined plate to drain. Serve piping hot with steamed<br>
                white rice and the lemon wedges on the side. Squeeze lemon juice on the chicken, to taste.</li>
            
        </ol>
