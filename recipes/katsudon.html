                peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mirin</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>4 fillets cooked tonkatsu,<br>
                each fillet cut into 1/2 inch slices</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked Japanese white rice</li>
            <p>(Optional)</p>
            <li>8 sprigs mitsuba parsley,<br>
                stems and leaves coursely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the onion, dashi, sake, mirin, and soy sauce to a saucepan <br>
                and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, <br>
                until the onions soften.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Break 2 eggs into a bowl and lightly beat the eggs, no more than <br>
                10 times. You want part of the yolk and whites to be lightly mixed,<br>
                while other parts are still separated. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To prepare the katusdon one serving at a time, pour one-fourth <br>
                of the sauce and onions into a small skillet. A 6-inch skillet works great.<br>
                Place a sliced tonkatsu fillet in the sauce. Place over high heat <br>
                and cook for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour three-fourths of the egg mixture over the tonkatsu, onions, and sauce.<br>
                Do not mix. Cook for about 1 minute, then add the remaining one-fourth <br>
                egg over the ingredients in the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook for <br>
                30 seconds more. Turn off the heat, and let the katsudon rest, covered, <br>
                for 1 minute.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While the katsudon is resting, scoop 1 1/2 cups of the cooked rice into <br>
                a serving bowl. When the katsudon is ready, uncover, and slide entire contents <br>
                out of the skillet to rest on the rice. Tilt the skillet and use a spatula <br>
                if necessary; the katsudon should slide out easily.<br>
                Garnish with mitsuba and serve immediately.<br>
                Repeat for the remaining servings.</li>
        </ol>
