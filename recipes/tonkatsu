        <p>Our guilty pleasure, a crispy, fried Japanese pork cutlet. <br>

        </ul>

        
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice the cabbage as thinly as possible using a knife or mandoline.<br>
            Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To prepare the pork fillets, lay the fillets flat on a cutting board.<br>
                tap the fillets with the back edge of a kitchen knife to dig notches <br>
                into the meat. Turn the knife so that the flat side is facing the fillets.<br>
                Pound the meat with the knife's flat side about 6 to 8 times on<br>
                each side of the pork to flatten the meat to about 1/2 inch thick.<br>
                Cut 1/2-inch notches into the white fat of the fillets, which will <br>
                prevent the fillet from curling when frying. Season the fillets on both sides <br>
                with salt and pepper. Transfer the prepared pork fillets to a plate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and set aside. Prepare 4 plates.<br>
                Pour the flour onto the first plate.<br>
                Pour the beaten egg onto the second plate.<br>
                Leave the fourth plate empty for now, this will hold the breaded fillets</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place a cast-iron skillet on a burner. Fill the skillet with vegetable oil<br>
                to a height of at least 1 inch. Attach a deep-fry or candy thermometer<br>
                to the side of the skillet. On a worksurface near the skillet, set up a tray<br>
                lined with newspaper or paper towels to drain the cooked tonkatsu.<br>
                Turn the heat on to high. Heat the oil to 340 F.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While the oil is heating, bread the fillets. First, dredge a fillet in flour<br>
                on both sides and shake off excess flour. Second, dip the fillet into the egg,<br>
                coating both sides. Third, repeat the process, dredging the pork in the flour<br>
                again on both sides, then coating it again with egg on both sides.<br>
                Finally, lay the fillet on the panko crumbs. Pile panko on top of the pork<br>
                with your fingers then gently press the panko onto the fillet with the palms<br>
                of your hand so a generous layer of panko sticks to the fillet on both sides.<br>
                Repeat with the other fillets, then place them on the empty plate you prepared earlier.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the oil has heated to 340 F, carefully slide the fillets into the skillet.<br>
                Depending on the size of the skillet, cook the tonkatsu in batches.<br>
                Be careful not to overfill the skillet, which will lower the cooking temperature;<br>
                use, at most, half of the surface area of the oil to cook. While the tonkatsu<br>
                is cooking, check the oil temperature with the thermometer. Regulate the heat <br>
                to maintain a constant 340 F oil temperature. If the oil is too hot, the tonkatsu<br>
                will burn; if it is too hot, the tonkatsu will burn; if it is too low, the tonkatsu <br>
                will come out soft and greasy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook the tonkatsu for about 4 minutes, turning once, until the fillets<br>
                turn golden brown. When they're ready, transfer the fillets to the paper-lined plate <br>
                to drain. If possible, stand the fillets on their edges, so they drain better.<br>
                You can accomplish this with a metal rack, if you have one.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer the tonkatsu to a cutting board and slice into strips. For each serving, <br>
                place the pork on a plate, along with a heap of sliced cabbage and a dab of mustard.<br>
                Serve topped with about 2 tablespoons of tonkatsu sauce or serve the sauce on the side.<br>
                Serve piping hot with steamed white rice on the side.</li>
        </ol>
